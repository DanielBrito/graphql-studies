# Fullstack TypeScript (feat. GraphQL & Node.js)

_TypeScript offers a delightful authoring experience, but all bets are off once you make an API call and receive an `any` response. We'll build a Twitter App with React and generate TypeScript code based on a GraphQL schema. Combine TypeScript and GraphQL's type systems to create full-stack, fully-type-checked codebases (even the data layer!), making the entire codebase shockingly easy to evolve, refactor and maintain._
